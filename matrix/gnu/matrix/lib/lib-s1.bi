The ﬁrst row is the 1st (ﬁrst) row, and the ﬁrst column is the 1st (ﬁrst)
column. (Again, we remark that computer entities used in some systems to
represent matrices and to store elements of matrices as computer data some-
times index the elements beginning with 0. Furthermore, some systems use
the ﬁrst index to represent the column and the second index to indicate the
row. We are not speaking here of the storage order—“row major” versus “col-
umn major”—we address that later, in Chap. 11. Rather, we are speaking of
the mechanism of referring to the abstract entities. In image processing, for
example, it is common practice to use the ﬁrst index to represent the col-
umn and the second index to represent the row. In the software packages IDL
and PV-Wave, for example, there are two diﬀerent kinds of two-dimensional
objects: “arrays”, in which the indexing is done as in image processing, and
“matrices”, in which the indexing is done as we have described.)
